                    Robert Frost (1874–1963) was an American poet renowned for his deep and evocative exploration of rural New England life. 
                    He received four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry and is often regarded as one of the greatest American poets of the 20th 
                    century. Frost’s works are characterized by their simplicity and accessibility, but they also often contain layers 
                    of complexity and profound insight into human nature. His best-known poems, such as *The Road Not Taken* and *Stopping 
                    by Woods on a Snowy Evening*, have become iconic parts of American literary culture. Frost’s poetry often deals with 
                    themes of nature, rural life, personal reflection, and the human condition. He remains one of the most celebrated poets 
                    in American history.
