                    Amanda Gorman is an American poet and activist, best known for her powerful poem The Hill We Climb, which she recited at the inauguration of President Joe Biden in 2021. Gorman became the youngest poet to perform at a presidential inauguration, and her work has been praised for its themes of unity, resilience, and social justice. She is also the author of The One for Whom Food Is Not Enough and Call Us What We Carry. Gorman’s poetry often addresses issues of race, gender, and inequality, and she continues to be a prominent voice in contemporary American poetry.
