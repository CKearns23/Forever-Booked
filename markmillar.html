                    Mark Millar is a New York Times best-selling writer known for his groundbreaking work in the comic book industry.
                    His most popular creations include *Wanted*, *Kick-Ass*, *The Secret Service*, *Jupiter’s Legacy*, and *Nemesis*. 
                    Many of his works have been adapted into successful films, such as *Kick-Ass* and *Kingsman: The Secret Service*, 
                    with Millar serving as Executive Producer on these adaptations. He has also written iconic stories for major 
                    comic book publishers, including *Superman: Red Son* for DC Comics and *The Ultimates* for Marvel Comics, 
                    the latter of which was named one of Time magazine’s top comics of the decade. Millar’s other notable works 
                    include *Wolverine: Old Man Logan*, *Civil War*, and *Jupiter’s Circle*. His creative influence continues to 
                    shape the world of comics and film, and he is currently a creative consultant to Fox Studios on their Marvel 
                    slate of movies.
