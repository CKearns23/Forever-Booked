                    successful and beloved franchises in literary history. The first book, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
                    Stone*, was published in 1997, and the series went on to sell over 500 million copies worldwide. Rowling's
                    books have not only captivated readers of all ages, but they've also had a profound impact on the world of

                    Vacancy* and the *Cormoran Strike* detective series under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. Her writing has
                    won numerous awards, and she continues to inspire fans with her tales of magic, adventure, and personal
                    growth. She is also an advocate for numerous social causes, including children's rights and poverty alleviation.
